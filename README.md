### Practical 5
To write a program to perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication of two numbers given as input by the user.

### Practical 6
To write a program to evaluate the following equations:
- V = u + at  
- S = ut + 1/2 at²  
- T = 2a + √b + 9c  
- H = √(b² + p²)

### Practical 7
To write a program to swap two variables:
- Using a temporary variable  
- Without using a temporary variable  

### Practical 8
To write a program to find the greatest among three numbers using:
- Conditional Operator  
- If-Else statement  

### Practical 9
To write programs using switch case statement:
